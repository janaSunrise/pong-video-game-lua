# Pong in Lua

This is a simple pong video game, coded in Lua, using the Love2D game Engine, with learning from the GD50 Course.

## How to run it?

To run this, you need the Love2D engine for lua, to run it. If you don't have it, get it [here](https://love2d.org/).
Once done, execute the following steps:

- Clone the repo
- Navigate into `src` folder.
- Run it using `love .` command.
And boom! It should work :)
